# UDP_clockSynchronization
Clock synchronization project for CSCI 5673

`make` to compile both client and server

`./client 2` to connect to local server on port 8100

Note: The client currently does not do retransmissions (just best-effort UDP)  
Note: The client and server are built for Linux and are not portable.
